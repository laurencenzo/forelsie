    <h2>for you my love,</h2>

    <p>
      HI, Mylove ,adii, mahaal. I just want to write you a quick letter about this moment we're sharing
      right now in our lives. Everything moves quickly. Time never stands still,
      and I know how fleeting every second is. The thing is, there's just no one
      I'd rather be with as this world keeps turning and turning. It's you I
      think of when I wake up in the morning. You make me feel motivated Every time I think of you,
      I feel inspired to become better day by day. I want you to know the many reasons why I love you. Your kindness to your friends, compassion, and dedication to our relationship inspire me every day. 
      I'm grateful for the love we share and for the chance to grow together, even when we're apart. I miss the days when we used to set an early alarm and walk to the seaside. Those mornings, just you and I, with the world still asleep,. The sound of the waves crashing against the shore, the warmth of the sun on our faces - those moments with you were truly special.
    I miss the way we would talk about life, dreams, and everything in between as we strolled along the shore. I miss simply being with you."I'm sorry if I am sometimes naughty or persistent during our video calls.
      If I make you overthink sometimes. I know I don't deserve you. I don't deserve your love, your kindness, your beauty.
      But I promise I will be a better person for you.
      I'm grateful for the love we share and for the chance to grow together, even when we're apart.
      Seeing you in our video calls, pictures, and even on TikTok makes my day complete. 
      You bring so much joy into my life. Happy Valentine's Day My love! Even though we're far apart, our love knows no bounds.
      As we celebrate love today, I want you to know that you're always in my heart, no matter the distance between us.
